		Your teeth are on of those things that once they’re gone, they’re not coming back. Most people don’t treat them as if that were the case though. But do you really want to end up looking like this?
<br>
<br>
Probably not, right?
<br>
<br> 
So why don’t most people take better care of their teeth? 
<br>
<br>
Well, I know for me personally, it usually comes down to good old-fashioned laziness; Either I’m in a rush and don’t have the time to brush, or I just don’t feel like making the effort. But this could obviouly lead to problems down the road...
<br>
<br>
So this got me to thinking, you would think that in 2022, human society would have concocted an easier to way to keep your teeth and entire oral cavity healthy... 
<br>
<br>
And I found one! But before we get into that, let me share with you some interesting (and scary!) information that I found online regarding oral health. 
<br>
<br>
		<ul>
			<li>The oral cavity contains over 700 microbal species
			</li>
			<li>the oral microbiota can be altered by a series of endogenous and exogenous factors including diet, smoking, alcohol, antibiotics and pregnancy
			</li>
			<li>These alterations can disrupt the bacterial equilibrium in the oral cavity by increasing hamrful bacteria and decreasing beneficial ones, leading to a series of infectious diseases such as periodontal diseases
			</li>
			<li>Sugar can lead to dental caries
			</li>
			<li>Fiber and dairy help maintain a healthy balance in the oral microbiota
			</li>
			<li>Smoking can alter oral microbiota by increasing acidity of saliva, depleting oxygen, and impairing host immunity 
			</li>

the use of antibiotics can produce changes in the oral microbiota by destroying many bacterial species and decreasing their enzymatic activity

in pregnancy the oral microbiota goes through some important changes, which leads to colonization of various microorganisms, especially periodontal pathogens that may be a risk to the health of the pregnant woman

diabetes, rheumatoid athritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, can increase inflammation in gums

changes in the oral microbiota can promote the development of systemic diseases
	-cardiovascular 
	-pneumonia
	-pancreatic cancer
	-colorectal cancer

the oral bacteria genus porphyromonas gingivalis is associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer and pancreatic cancer

fusobacteria is another genus that produces excessive immunoresponses that can lead to colorectal tumor formation

oral bacteria can also increase the risk of pneumonia



By age 8, over half of children (52%) have had a cavity in their primary (baby) teeth.
<br>
<br>
1 in 4 adults aged 20 to 64 currently has cavities.

Surprisingly, 25% of adults do not brush their teeth twice a day. Not brushing twice a day increases the risk of tooth decay by 33%.

Although flossing is essential, many people do not like doing it. A whopping 73% of Americans would go to the grocery store than floss their teeth.

Your smile is a strong point of attraction. 61% of adults admit that they are attracted to somebody’s smile alone.
		</ul>


And more and more science is coming out detailing the wide-reaching impact that poor dental health can have on overall bodily health.
