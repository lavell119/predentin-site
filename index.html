		<h1>Over 5 Million Healthy Oral Bacteria In One Gummy
		</h1>	
<br>
<br>
Your teeth are on of those things that once they’re gone, they’re not coming back. Most people don’t treat them as if that were the case though. But do you really want to end up looking like this?
<br>
<br>
Probably not, right?
<br>
<br> 
So why don’t most people take better care of their teeth? 
<br>
<br>
Well, I know for me personally, it usually comes down to good old-fashioned laziness; Either I’m in a rush and don’t have the time to brush, or I just don’t feel like making the effort. But this could obviouly lead to problems down the road...
<br>
<br>
So this got me to thinking, you would think that in 2022, human society would have concocted an easier to way to keep your teeth and entire oral cavity healthy... 
<br>
<br>
And I found one! But before we get into that, let me share with you some interesting (and scary!) information that I found online regarding oral health. 
<br>
<br>
		<ul class="facts-list">
			<li>
			Many common dental products (such as toothpaste and mouthwash) contain toxic ingredients that can destroy the microbiome in the mouth.
			</li>
			<li>
			The oral cavity contains over 700 species of bacteria
			</li>
			<li>
			Things like smoking, alcohol, antibiotics and pregnancy can disrupt the balance of bacteria in your oral cavity, leading to things like receding gums and tooth decay.
			</li>
			<li>
			Changes in the oral bacteria can also promote the development of systemic diseases like:
			</li>
				<ul class="sub-list">
					<li>Cardiovascular disease</li>
					<li>Pneumonia</li>
					<li>Pancreatic cancer</li>
					<li>Colorectal cancer</li>
				</ul>
			<li>
			By age 8, <u>over half</u> of children (52%) have had a cavity in their primary (baby) teeth.
			</li>
			<li>
			<u>1 in 4</u> adults aged 20 to 64 currently has cavities.
			</li>
			<li>
			<u>25% of adults</u> do not brush their teeth twice a day. Not brushing twice a day increases the risk of tooth decay by 33%.
			<li>
			Although flossing is essential, many people do not like doing it. A whopping <u>73% of Americans</u> would go to the grocery store than floss their teeth.
			</li>
			<li>
			Your smile is a strong point of attraction. <u>61% of adults</u> admit that they are attracted to somebody’s smile alone.
			</li>
		</ul>
<br>
So it’s not just your beautiful smile that’s suffering! An unclean mouth is literally a cesspool of harmful bacteria, destroying your oral cavity, and spreading harmful pathogens throughout your body. Is that a gross enough image?
<br>
<br>
Simple solution: brush and floss twice a day. But as I mentioned before, not everyone has time for that. And studies have even show that even If you brush every day, you could be missing large parts of your oral cavity. So, what’s the solution?
<br>
<br>
Something that’s easier and faster than brushing and flossing: chewing a gummy. 
<br>
<br>
But not just any gummy!
<br>
<br>
Prodentim is a clinically-backed gummy that I found online that supplies your oral cavity with all the healthy bacteria it might not be producing on its own. 
<br>
<br>
It contains a blend of 3.5 billion probiotics and nutrients, specifically designed to repopulate your mouth with good bacteria.
